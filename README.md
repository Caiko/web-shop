# 🛒 Web Shop Application

This project is a **web-based shop application** built using **React**. It allows users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and manage item quantities. The app is designed with a modern, clean interface using **Tailwind CSS** for styling and follows React's best practices for state management and component structure.

## 🚀 Features

- **Product Listing**: Browse a variety of products displayed in a responsive grid layout.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add items to the shopping cart, increase/decrease quantities, and remove items if needed.
- **Dynamic Cart Updates**: The total number of items in the cart dynamically updates as you add or modify items.
- **Modal Integration**: The cart is displayed in a modal that opens when the "Cart" button is clicked.
- **Prop Drilling for State Management**: The project uses prop drilling to manage state across components, ensuring proper data flow without the need for complex state management libraries.
- **Fully Functional and Styled**: The app is designed with a polished, professional look, leveraging **Tailwind CSS** for smooth transitions, hover effects, and responsive design.
